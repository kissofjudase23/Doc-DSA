## FAQ
  * [What is tail recursion?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33923/what-is-tail-recursion)

## [Walking through a Problem](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/resources.html)
  1. Listen Carefully
     * For example:
       * Given two arrays that are **sorted** ...
  2. Draw an Example
     * **There'a an art to drawing an example though**.
     * Most examples are too small or are special cases.
  3. State a Brute Force
     * Even if it's obvious for you, it's not ncecessarily obvious for all candidates. You don't want your interviewer to think you're struggling to see even the wasy solution.
  4. Optimize
     * Look for any **unused information**.
     * Use a fresh example
     * Solve it "incorrectly"
     * Make **time vs. space** tradeoff
     * **Precompute** information
       * Is there a way that you can reorganize the data (sortig, etc.)
     * Use a **hash table**
     * Thank about the best conceivable runtime
  5. Walk Through
     * Whiteboard coding is **slow**, you need to make sure that you get is as close to "perfect" in the beginning as possible.
  6. Implement
     * Modularized code
     * Error checks
       * A good compromise here is to add a todo and then just explain out loud what you'd like to test
     * Use other classes/structs where appropriate
     * Good variable names
  7. Test
     * Conceptual test
       * Does the code do what you think it should do?
     * Weird looking code
       * Doulbe check that line of code that says x = length -2.
     * Hot spots
       * Like base cases in recursive code. Integer division. Null nodes in binary tree.
     * Small test cases
     * Special cases
       * null of single element values.

## [Optimize & Solve Technique](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/resources.html)
1. Look for **BUD**
   * **B**ottlenecks *
    * For example, suppose you have a two-step algorithm where you first sort the array and then you find elements with a particular property.
      * The first step is O(nlong(n)) and the second step if O(n).
      * Perhaps you could reduce the second step to O(1), but would it matter? Not too much as o(nlong(n)) is the bottleneck
   * **U**nnecessary work
   * **D**uplicated work
2. Do it yourself
3. **Simplify and Generalize** *
   * First, we simplify or tweak some constraint, such as the data type. Then we solve this new simplified version of the problem. Finally, once we have an algorithm for the simplified problem, we try to adapt it for the more complex version.
4. **Base case and Build** **
   * Solve the problem first for a base case (e.g., n=1) and then try to build up from there. **When we get to more complex cases (often n=3 or n=4), we try to build those using the prior solution**.
5. Data Structure Brainstorm **
   * Try to run through a list of data structures and try to apply each one.
6. **Best Conceivable Runtime** (BCR)
   * The best conceivable runtie is, literally, the **best runtime** you could conceive of a solution to a problem. You can easily prove that there is no way you could beat the BCR.

## Math

### Reverse
* 7. Reverse Integer
  * Notice the boundary
  ```python
  def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
    is_positive = True if x >=0 else False
    reverse = 0
    boundary = (2 ** 31)//10 # 2147483640

    if not is_positive:
        x = -x

    while x:
        pop = x % 10
        x //= 10
        # boundary = 214748364
        # boundary * 10 = 2147483640
        # 2**31 = 2147483648 = 2147483640 + 8 = boundary * 10 + 8
        if reverse > boundary or reverse == boundary and pop > 7 :
            return 0

        reverse = reverse * 10 + pop

    if not is_positive:
        reverse = -reverse

    return reverse
  ```
### Sum
  * 1: Two Sum (E)
    * Time: O(n), Space: O(n)
      * Use hash table
  * 15: 3Sum (M)
    * Time O(n^2)
      1. **Sort** first
      2. For each target (from 0 to n-3)
           * Find left and right pair that num[target] + num[left] + num[right] = 0
           * Target = -num[target] = num[left] + num[right]
    * Why does the algorithm work?
        * Assume that we find a correct target for num[left] + num[right]
          * case1: x
            * nums[left+1] + nums[right+1] > Target
          * case2: x
            * nums[left-1] + nums[right-1] < Target.
          * case3: âœ“
            * nums[left+1] + nums[right-1] may be possible.
          * case4: x
            * nums[left-1] + nums[r+1] has been traverse before.
    * Python Solution
        ```python
        def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:

          res = list()
          nums.sort()

          for i in range(0, len(nums)-2):

              # skip duplicate
              if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                  continue

              l, r = i+1, len(nums)-1

              while l < r:

                  s = nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r]

                  if s < 0:
                      l += 1

                  elif s > 0:
                      r -= 1

                  else:
                      res.append([nums[i],nums[l],nums[r]])

                      # skip duplicate
                      while l < r and nums[l] == nums[l+1]:
                          l += 1
                      while l < r and nums[r] == nums[r-1]:
                          r -= 1

                      l+=1
                      r-=1

            return res
        ```

* A trie is a variant of an n-ary tree in which characters are stored at each node. Each path down the tree may represent a word.
* Used to store collections of words.
  * If 2 words have a common prefix then they will have the same ancesctors in this trie.

  ```
* Use cases:
  * **Prefix** lookups.
  * **Whole word** lookups.
  * Autocomplete
  * Spell checker

* FAQ
  * Compare with Hash Table
    * While a hash table can quickly loop up whether a string is a valid word, **it cannot tell us if a string is a prefix of any words**.
    * A trie can check if a string is a valid prefix in O(k), where k is the length of the string. Although we often refer to hash table loopups as being O(1) time, this isn't entirely true. **A hash table must read though all the characters in the input**, which takes **O(k)** time in the case of a word lookup.

#### Insertion Sort
  * Best Case: ascending sequence, [1, 2, 3]
  * Worst Case: descending sequence, [3, 2, 1]
#### Selection Sort
  * Unstable: [5, 5*, 3]
#### Bubble Sort
  * Best Case:
    * ascending sequence, [1, 2, 3]
    * (n-1) comparison in round1, and no swap happened.
  * Worst Case:
    * descending sequence, [3, 2, 1]
#### [Heap Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterative-heap-sort/)
  * Build the Max Heap first
  * Iteratve n-1 round, for i in range(n-1, 0, -1)
    * Swap the current max(0th index) to the ith index
    * heapify from 0 to i-1

### Dynamic Programming
#### Recursion and Dynamic Programming
   * Recursive
     * By definition, are built of solutions to subproblems.
     * **Bottom-Up** Approach
       * It often the most intuitive.
     * **Top-Down** Approach
       * The top-down solution can be more complex since it's less concrete.
     * **Half-and-Half** Approach
       * Like merge sort and binary search
     * Recursive vs. Iteration Solutions
       * Recursive algorithms can be very **space inefficient**. Each recursive call adds a new layer to the stack.
       * For this reason, it's often better to implement a recurisve algorithm iteratively.

#### Dynamic Programming & Memorization
  * Dynamic Programming is mostly just a matter of taking a **recursive algorithm** and **finding the overlapping subproblems**. You then cache those results for future recursive calls.
  * Example:
    * resursive: O(n^2), O(n)

      ```python
      def fib(i):
        if i == 0 or i == 1:
            return i

        return fib(i-1) + fib(i-2)
      ```
    * Iterative: O(n), O(1)

      ```python
      def fib(i):
         if i == 0 or i == 1:
            return i

          a, b = 0, 1
          for _ in range(2, i+1):
            a, b = b, a + b

          return a

      ```
    * **Top-Down** Dynamic Programming (or Memoization): O(n), O(n)

      ```python
      def fib(i):

        memo = dict()

        def _fib(i):
          if i == 0 or i == 1:
            return i

          if i not in memo:
            memo[i] = _fib(i-1), _fib(i-2)

          return memo[i]

        return _fib(i)

      ```
    * **Bottom-Up** Dynamic Programming: O(n), O(n)

      ```python
      def fib(i):

        if i == 0 or i == 1:
            return i

        memo = dict()
        memo[0] = 0
        memo[1] = 1

        for f in range(2, i+1):
          memo[f] = memo[f-1] + memo[f-2]

        return memo[i]
      ```
