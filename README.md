## [Data Structures](https://github.com/kissofjudase23/Library-python-common-modules/tree/master/common/ds)


### Linked List
* Tips
  * The **"Runner"** Techinique (or second pointer)
    * The runner techinique means that you iterate through the linked list with two pointers simultaneously, with one head of the other.
    * Loop issues, find the middle, etc.

#### Binary Tree
* Unbalanced Tree
* Types
  * Binary search Trees:
    * **All left descendents <= n < all right descendents**
  * Complete Binary Trees
    * A binary tree in which every level of the tree if **fully filled, except the rightmost element on the last level.
  * Full Binary Trees
    * A binary tree in which every node has **either zero of two children**.
  * Perfect Binary Trees
    * A binary tree is one that **full and complete**.
    * All leaf nodes will be at the same level, and this level has the maximum number of nodes.

* Traversal
  * In-Order
    ```python
      def in_order_traversal(node):

        if not node:
          return

        in_order_traversal(node.left)
        visit(node)
        in_order_traversal(node.right)
    ```
  * Pre-Order
    ```python
      def pre_order_traversal(node):

        if not node:
          return

        visit(node)
        pre_order_traversal(node.left)
        pre_order_traversal(node.right)
    ```
  * Post-Order
    ```python
      def post_order_traversal(node):

        if not node:
          return

        post_order_traversal(node.left)
        post_order_traversal(node.right)
        visit(node)
    ```
#### Binary Heaps (Min-Heaps and Max-Heaps)
* **complete binary tree**
* Min-Heaps
  * Ascencding order
* Max-Heaps
  * Descending Order
* Insert
  * Takes O(log(n)) (bubble up)
  * Insert at the **rightmost spot so as to maintain the complete binary tree**.
  * **Fix the tree by swapping the new element with parents**, until finding the appropriate spot.
* Extract minimum (maximum) elements
  * Takes O(log(n)) (bubble down)
  * Remove the mimimum element and swap it with the last element in the heap.
  * Bubble down this element, swapping it with one of its children until the min-heap property is restored.

#### Quick Sort
  * FAQ
    * [Why does QuickSort use O(log(n)) extra space?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12573330/why-does-quicksort-use-ologn-extra-space)
      * To get rid of the recursive call you would have to use **a stack** in your code, and it would still occupy **log(n)** space.
    * [Quick sort implement by queue?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39666714/quick-sort-implement-by-queue)
      * Queue method requires O(n) space for sorting an array of size n.
  * Worst Case:
    * [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      * round1:
        * pivot: 5
        * left partition [1, 2, 3, 4]
        * right partition []
      * round2:
        * pivot: 4
        * left partition [1, 2, 3]
        * right partition []
      * ...
    * Solution:
      * Use median of three to pick pivot

    * T(n) = T(n-1) + cn

  * Unstable Case:
    * [quicksort algorithm stability](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13498213/quicksort-algorithm-stability)
    * [4, 2, 1 ,4*, 3]
      * round1:
        * partition:
          * pivot: 3
          * [2, 1, 3 ,4*, 4]

#### Insertion Sort
  * Best Case: ascending sequence, [1, 2, 3]
  * Worst Case: descending sequence, [3, 2, 1]
#### Selection Sort
  * Unstable: [5, 5*, 3]
#### Bubble Sort
  * Best Case:
    * ascending sequence, [1, 2, 3]
    * (n-1) comparison in round1, and no swap happened.
  * Worst Case:
    * descending sequence, [3, 2, 1]
